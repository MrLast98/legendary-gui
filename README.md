# WARNING & CREDITS
This is a legendary GUI made by me, for the CLI.

> Code is provided AS IS. This is a personal project and someone else might want to use it, it's not official.  
> If your pc explodes it isn't my fault (although the code should be pretty safe).  
> I haven't tested it extensively, this isn't even the best way to make a GUI, and it took me a day or two, so don't expect much.  
> All the work was done by [derrod](https://github.com/derrod) on his [legendary project](https://github.com/derrod/legendary).  
> I just made this simple GUI to work the CLI since i couldn't be bothered to actually use the terminal each time i wanted to use it.  

## Installation and Usage
Since i haven't compiled it for each platform right now, just drop the file **in the same folder as the legendary executable** and run it.

```
python3 main.py
```
It should work, in case it doesn't probably you're missing Kivy or you're running it with python2. Or something else, let me know if you find a dumb error and i may fix it.

## What works:
- Installing
  - There is no way of checking the output in the GUI, maybe through console
- Launching the games
- Login

## To-do list
- [ ] Actually try to implement it through code rather than making it run CLI commands and catching the output
- [ ] Cleaning up the design, since it's rough as hell
- [ ] Find how to streamline the compilation process so it's actually executables and not a file
- [ ] ????
- [ ] Profit.
